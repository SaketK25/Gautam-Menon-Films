    Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu (2012) is a heartfelt romantic drama directed by Gautham Menon, showcasing his mastery in exploring the intricacies of relationships. The film is the Telugu version of his bilingual project, with Nani and Samantha Ruth Prabhu in the lead roles.

<p>
Gautham Menon adopts a subtle and realistic approach to storytelling, making the characters and their emotions feel relatable and authentic. The performances by Nani and Samantha are exemplary, with their chemistry and emotional depth breathing life into the narrative. Samantha, in particular, received widespread acclaim for her portrayal of Nithya, a character full of grace and complexity.
